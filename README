USAGE:
Just be sure go.sh and minerd  are in the same directory and run:
./go.sh

DESCRIPTION:
This is a binary repository for Tenerbrix Litecoin miner, all binaries are compiled with the following:
"-fno-builtin -fno-strict-aliasing -Ofast -pipe" -march is the only difference in each binary. If you 
are cloning this directory then please do:

ln -sf minerd-yourcpu minerd

If you are not cloning and just wanting to run the miner, then copy go.sh to your minerd directory and
the appropriate minerd-cpu to that same directory but rename the file to just be "minerd" 

The go.sh script was wrote by Daniel Robbins, it detects your cpu's number of threads and then connects / long
polls at the http://lc.ozco.in litecoin server. 

The source code to Tenebrix Litecoin miner is in the src/ directory if you prefer to compile with your own 
optimizations, or if you'd just like to view the source code.  No source code has been modified from the original

Enjoy these binaries!

Special Thanks to Daniel Robbins, Funtoo, Tenebrix :D
